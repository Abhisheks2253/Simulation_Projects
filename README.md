## Course Projects for IE 551: Simulation and Stochastic Models
**This course on computer simulation covers spreadsheet simulation, discrete event simulation, system dynamics simulation and agent-based simulation with the focus on key statistical analysis of data and practice-oriented theory**

## Project 1: Grabage Recycling Decision case
- Seymour, a medium-sized midwestern community, is planning to upgrade the incinerating system of its recycling center to keep up with increasing demand. There are three options to fuel the system: natural gas (NG), bunker oil (BO) and wood (W). Each of the three fuels involves different investment costs, operating expense rates and material cost rates
- **The task is to evaluate the options and make a recommendation and explain the risks to city planners** 
- **Key points considered:** Mean Net Present Value (NPV) the risks associated with each fuel choice

## Project 2: Call Center Simulation case
- Software Made Personal (SMP) customizes software products in three basic areas: financial tracking, personal productivity and contract management. 
- They currently have a customer support call center that handles technical questions for owners of their software from the hours of 8 AM to 4 PM Eastern Time. 
- SMP is hoping to reduce the total number of operators they need by cross-training operators so that they can answer calls for any product line. Since the operators will not be experts across all products, this is expected to increase the time to process a call by about 10%. 
- **The task is to calculate the optimal number of operators to achieve the same levels of service in the cross-trained system**
- We use Queuing models to approximate the expected number and expected time in the hold queues in the current system and the proposed system

## Project 3: Job Shop design 
- The task is to design a 3-shift, continuously operating job shop that will be comprised of 5 machine groups, each with a number of identical machines.
- The cost is as follows: **Casting Units $1.0; Lathes $7.0; Planers $2.0; Drill Presses; $3.0 Shapers $1.5**
- The job arrival rate into the system is given but there is no data available on the job processing times. The processing times for each machine are approximated based on experience of other plants.
- **The company is interested in determining how many of each type of machine to purchase within their budget of $40 million**. 
- The primary performance measures of interest are the long-run cycle time (flowtime) for each job type; also of interest are the long-run number of waiting jobs at each machine group (because space is an issue, and work-in-process inventory is expensive)
